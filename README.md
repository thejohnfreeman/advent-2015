These are my solutions to the [2015 Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).
Below, I list the programming themes for each problem, and my rating of my
solution based on the following scale:

:star: - __Unhappy.__ I suspect there is a better idiomatic approach that I just haven't
seen yet.  
:star::star: - __Satisfied.__ I think I got the right approach, but there might
be some tweaks that could make it more concise, more readable, or faster.  
:star::star::star: - __Happy.__ I think I got close to an optimal solution.
